  abstract = {Spacecrafts in space environment are exposed to several kinds of thermal sources such as radiation, albedo and emitted IR from the earth. The thermal control subsystem in spacecraft is used to keep all parts operating within allowable temperature ranges. A failure in one or many temperature sensors could lead to abnormal operation. Consequently, a prediction process must be performed to replace the missing data with estimated values to prevent abnormal behavior. The goal of the proposed model is to predict the failed or missing sensor readings based on artificial neural networks (ANN). It has been applied to EgyptSat-1 satellite. A backpropagation algorithm called Levenberg-Marquardt is used to train the neural networks (NN). The proposed model has been tested by one and two hidden layers. Practical metrics such as mean square error, mean absolute error and the maximum error are used to measure the performance of the proposed network. The results showed that the proposed model predicted the values of one failed sensor with adequate accuracy. It has been employed for predicting the values of two failed sensors with an acceptable mean square and mean absolute errors; whereas the maximum error for the two failed sensors exceeded the acceptable limits.},

We provide evidence that different ways of defining, identifying, and handling outliers alter substantive research conclusions. Then, we report results of a literature review of 46 methodological sources (i.e., journal articles, book chapters, and books) addressing the topic of outliers, as well as 232 organizational science journal articles mentioning issues about outliers. Our literature review uncovered (a) 14 unique and mutually exclusive outlier definitions, 39 outlier identification techniques, and 20 different ways of handling outliers; (b) inconsistencies in how outliers are defined, identified, and handled in various methodological sources; and (c) confusion and lack of transparency in how outliers are addressed by substantive researchers. We offer guidelines, including decision-making trees, that researchers can follow to define, identify, and handle error, interesting, and influential (i.e., model fit and prediction) outliers. Although our emphasis is on regression, structural equation modeling, and multilevel modeling, our general framework forms the basis for a research agenda regarding outliers in the context of other data-analytic approaches. Our recommendations can be used by authors as well as journal editors and reviewers to improve the consistency and transparency of practices regarding the treatment of outliers in organizational science research.},

  abstract = {The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) launched on August 12, 2005 and began aerobraking at Mars in March 2006. In order to save propellant, MRO used aerobraking to modify the initial orbit at Mars. The spacecraft passed through the atmosphere briefly on each orbit; during each pass the spacecraft was slowed by atmospheric drag, thus lowering the orbit apoapsis. The largest area on the spacecraft, most affected by aeroheating, was the solar arrays. A thermal analysis of the solar arrays was conducted at NASA Langley Research Center to simulate their performance throughout the entire roughly 6-month period of aerobraking. A companion paper describes the development of this thermal model. This model has been correlated against many sets of flight data. Several maneuvers were performed during the cruise to Mars, such as thruster calibrations, which involve large abrupt changes in the spacecraft orientation relative to the sun. The data obtained from these maneuvers allowed the model to be well-correlated with regard to thermal mass, conductive connections, and solar response well before arrival at the planet. Correlation against flight data for both in-cruise maneuvers and drag passes was performed. Adjustments made to the model included orientation during the drag pass, solar flux, Martian surface temperature, through-array resistance, aeroheating gradient due to angle of attack, and aeroheating accommodation coefficient. Methods of correlation included comparing the model to flight temperatures, slopes, temperature deltas between sensors, and solar and planet direction vectors. Correlation and model accuracy over 400 aeroheating drag passes were determined, with overall model accuracy better than 5°C.},

  abstract = {Information on battery problems can be useful in guiding research to improve battery technology. Problems that are serious or reoccur are the obvious ones to concentrate on. Observed problems can be caused by more than one phenomenon. However the problem that was observed on the Alsat-1 battery module where some cells were damaged, and the damage was caused by the extreme temperatures, an explanation can be brought to this problem is that the two different inserts (simple insert and hard insert) are very close which caused an increase in heat flux. The inserts used to support the battery in the honeycomb panel have a serious impact on the conduction from the solar panel to the battery pack, and so the temperature of the solar panel closer to the battery determines its temperature. Thus for this reason the simulation was performed to see carefully this phenomenon caused by the thermal coupling of the surrounding inserts and the important feedback from the results obtained in order to avoid all risky design in the future on the Algerian satellites such as Alsat-1B. Thermal simulations showed that the adjacent inserts cause thermal interference and the adjacent inserts are highly sensitive to the effect of high temperatures. The different results obtained in this paper are very helpful in the preliminary design stage of the spacecraft and which is a very promising application in the design of satellite electrical power subsystem.},

  abstract = {Small satellites are becoming more popular in the space sector, primarily due to their lower cost and shorter development time. Much of the information available about satellite thermal analysis and control refers to larger spacecraft. Sorting through this information to find the practices specifically applicable for small satellites can be a daunting task, particularly for inexperienced engineers. This thesis study is intended to inform the reader about basic thermal control and analysis methods that relate specifically to small satellites in low Earth orbit. A case study involving a satellite designed by the Missouri University of Science and Technology Satellite Research Team is presented to demonstrate the use of computer software for thermal analysis and the thermal control methods used to ensure that the satellite electrical component temperatures remain in the necessary range for proper operation. The process presented in the case study involves the construction of multiple revisions of the potential satellite thermal model. The analysis results presented demonstrate how increasing model complexity and nodal resolution affect resulting satellite temperatures. The passive thermal control method of manipulating satellite surface optical properties is used to raise the satellite component temperatures to the necessary range.},

Solar array panels are needed to covert solar radiation into electrical energy which is used by all of subsystem satellite as energy to keep functioning. The larger the area of solar array panel, more greater to the energy obtanied. Solar cell should in working temperature, if they experience excessive heat can be decrease the efficiency. If there is a decrease in efficiency in the solar cell, it will have an impact on the decrease in power produced.

This type of adaptation often requires the use of computer simulations to evaluate fitness of a large number of candidate solutions. Simulations are required to be expedient and accurate so that solutions can be successfully transferred to reality. We explore a design process that involves three steps. On a first step candidate solutions (implemented as surface paint tiling patterns) are tested using a FEM model and ranked according to their quality to meet mission temperature requirements. On a second step the best individual is implemented as a real physical satellite mockup and tested inside a vacuum chamber, having light sources imitating the effect of solar light. On a third step the simulation model is adapted with data obtained during the real evaluation. These updated models can be further employed for continuing genetic search. Current differences between our simulation and our real physical setup are in the order of 1.45 °K mean squared error for faces pointing toward the light source and 2.4 °K mean squared errors for shadowed faces. We found that evolved tiling patterns can be 5°K below engineered patterns and 8 °K below using unpainted aluminum satellite surfaces.},

Firstly, we consider a satellite model consisting of two isothermal parts (nodes): an outer part that absorbs heat from the environment as radiation of various types and radiates heat as a black-body, and an inner part that just dissipates heat at a constant rate. The resulting system of two nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the satellite’s temperatures is analyzed with various methods, which prove that the temperatures approach a steady state if the heat input is constant, whereas they approach a limit cycle if it varies periodically. Secondly, we generalize those methods to study a many-node thermal model of a spacecraft: this model also has a stable steady state under constant heat inputs that becomes a limit cycle if the inputs vary periodically. Finally, we propose new numerical analyses of spacecraft thermal models based on our results, to complement the analyses normally carried out with commercial software packages.},

  abstract = {The ongoing revolution of space access by means of cost-effective and highly performant small satellites, in particular CubeSats, drives the development of a vast host of new and increasingly complex applications. However, the use of small satellites for ambitious missions brings its own challenges with thermal breakdown as one of the key contributors to component failure. We have therefore developed a lightweight approach specifically tailored to the thermal modeling of small satellites to localize and mitigate the associated thermal risks while maintaining the flexibility and low resource footprint necessary to be applicable in the framework of small satellite mission design. At the core of the methodology, we implemented an experimental database of physical parameters as well as highly parallelized numerical analysis methods. In particular, we introduce an efficient way to determine view factors for insolation and internal radiative energy transport based on a hemicube radiosity algorithm. The results agree within 1 K with commercially available modeling software and allow us to perform highly reliable temperature predictions while conserving the flexible and cost-efficient spirit of small satellite missions.},

  abstract = {Images captured by Lapan-A3 pushbroom imager will have some geometric distortions from various sources. Most of them can be ideally corrected by using a high quality ancillary data, i.e. Lapan-A3 attitude sensor must provide attitude data for each image line (2,5ms) and free from measurement error. That ideal condition is nearly impossible to achieve so this paper aims to determine the minimum performance of Lapan-A3 ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control System) so that the image captured can still be well corrected with systematic geometric correction software. Three aspects being evaluated are accuracy and sampling frequency of attitude sensor, as well as the stability mode of ACS. Simulation results show that 10 Hertz sampling frequency of attitude data is needed when ACS closed loop mode is used, while 1/3 Hertz sampling frequency is enough when ACS open loop mode is used. Accuracy of attitude sensor should be better than 0,003° for pitch/roll axis and 0,02° for yaw axis. Related with ACS stability mode, image correction is way easier if observation is done under open loop mode since in closed loop mode there will be random jitter error. If the observation is done under closed loop mode then ACS should have pointing stability of 0,002°, far from current Lapan-A3 ACS pointing stability under closed loop mode, which is 0,1°.},

  abstract = {LAPAN-A3/IPB satellite was launched in June 2016 and its multispectral imager has been producing Indonesian coverage images. In order to improve its support for remote sensing application, the imager should produce images with high quality and quantity. To improve the quantity of LAPAN-A3/IPB multispectral image captured, image acquisition could be executed in real-time mode from LAPAN ground station in Bogor when the satellite passes west Indonesia region. This research analyses the performance of LAPAN-A3/IPB multispectral imager acquisition in real-time mode, in terms of image quality and quantity, under assumption of several on-board and ground segment limitations. Results show that with real-time operation mode, LAPAN-A3/IPB multispectral imager could produce twice as much as image coverage compare to recorded mode. However, the images produced in real-time mode will have slightly degraded quality due to image compression process involved. Based on several analyses that have been done in this research, it is recommended to use real-time acquisition mode whenever it possible, unless for some circumstances that strictly not allow any quality degradation of the images produced.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves               1               and in the first imaging of a black hole               2               . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

The imager data is transmitted from satellite to ground station by S-band video analog signal transmission, and then processed by ground station to become sequence of 8-bit enhanced and contrasted images. Data processing of LAPAN-A3/IPB thermal imager is more difficult than visual digital camera, especially for mosaic and classification purpose. This research aims to describe simple mosaic and classification process of LAPAN-A3/IPB thermal imager based on several videos data produced by the imager. The results show that stitching using Adobe Photoshop produces excellent result but can only process small area, while manual approach using ImageJ software can produce a good result but need a lot of works and time consuming. The mosaic process using image cross-correlation by Matlab offers alternative solution, which can process significantly bigger area in significantly shorter time processing. However, the quality produced is not as good as mosaic images of the other two methods. The simple classifying process that has been done shows that the thermal image can classify three distinct objects, i.e.: clouds, sea, and land surface. However, the algorithm fail to classify any other object which might be caused by distortions in the images. All of these results can be used as reference for development of thermal imager in LAPAN-A4 satellite.},

It must provide data in real-time to the spacecraft operators, as if they were transmitted from the real spacecraft, with the best possible fidelity. All spacecraft subsystems are presented in the OSS and their computer models need not only be representative of the real subsystem performance behavior, but also computationally inexpensive, such that real or near real telemetry response simulation is guaranteed. The spacecraft simulation model used for its thermal design is usually computationally expensive for application in OSS, and simplified models must be developed for this purpose. In this work, the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is investigated as a potential estimator of the spacecraft thermal behavior in orbit. The trained ANNs are used to provide the transient thermal behavior of a simplified model of a hypothetical CubeSat in Earth orbit. Results show that the ANN can reproduce with good fidelity the orbit temperatures generated by a thermal simulation software including points not used for training.},

The program calculates orbit data for inclined and sunsynchronous earth orbits. Traditional orbit analyses require extensive knowledge of orbital mechanics to produce a simplified set of data for thermal engineers. This program was created to perform orbital analyses with minimal input and provides the necessary output for thermal analysis codes. Engineers will find the program to be a valuable analysis tool for fast and simple orbit calculations. A description of the program inputs and outputs is included. An overview of orbital mechanics for inclined and Sun-synchronous orbits is also presented. Finally, several sample cases are presented to illustrate the thermal analysis applications of the program.},

As the mass of a satellite decreases, the satellite becomes increasingly vulnerable to temperature changes induced by varying orbital heat loads. In order to assure that on-orbit satellite component temperatures are maintained within manufacturing limits, satellite heat transfer must be accurately modeled during the design and analysis of any small satellite. This paper addresses thermal modeling used during the design and analysis of the Combat Sentinel Satellite (CSSAT). An overview of the analysis used to make design decisions and create working thermal models is discussed. A thermal model of the satellite developed using SDRC I-deas Thermal Model Generator (TMG) is also explained. Results from thermal vacuum chamber (TVAC) tests are presented and compared to the analysis. Finally, the correlated thermal model is used to predict temperatures during extreme orbital heating environments.},

In particular, these orbits allow us to build the Multi Sun-Synchronous Constellations, whose mechanism is briefly introduced here. By applying the Sun-Synchronicity constraint to the Flower Constellations theory, the Sun-Synchronous Flower Constellations have been derived. For these constellations, however, the synchronization is referring to the relative trajectory in a reference frame that rotates with Earth’s mean motion rather than to the Earth-Centered Inertial frame. Finally, by merging the concepts of Multi Sun-Synchronicity and the Flower Constellations, the Multi Sun-Synchronous Flower Constellations are obtained.},

  abstract = {There are a large number of engineering applications wherein estimation of radiation exchange between surfaces is required. One important part of the latter procedure is to obtain the so-called ‘view factor’ of the emitter–receiver combination. The principal aim of this article is to present finite-element based procedures to obtain view factor with good time efficiency. As such routines presented here compute the view factor between a non-uniform emitter field and the receiving surface. An example of this is ground-reflected solar radiation to thermal or photovoltaic collectors, the foreground itself being composed of surfaces that have wide-ranging reflectivities. Four routines have been presented here: one based on a uniform grid for emitting and receiving surfaces using a brute force approach (Uniform Populous Grid (UPG)), and another that used non-uniform grid for the receiving surface, where cells’ sizes increased in arithmetic progression as one withdraws from the common edge (Non Uniform Grid Populous (NUGP)). The last two routines used combinations of the first two approaches with Monte-Carlo approach (Uniform Grid Monte-Carlo (UGMC) and Non Uniform Grid Monte-Carlo (NUGMC)). It was found that the NUGP algorithm was the most efficient to reduce the calculation error for the same number of computations, it was about 450 times (430 for non-uniform reflectivity) more accurate than UPG, 160 (125) times more than UGMC and 70 (60) times more than NUGMC. Finally a comparison of advantages and disadvantages of all four considered routines was added, using the following criteria: ease of programming, computational execution time, accuracy of results obtained, and predictability of the errors.},

The use of commercial hardware and simple embedded designs has become an effective path for university programs to put experimental payloads in space for minimal cost, and the development of sensors for attitude and heading determination is often a critical part. The development of two compact and efficient but simple coarse sun sensor methodologies is presented in this research. A direct measurement of the solar angle uses a photodiode array sensor and slit mask. Another estimation of the solar angle uses current measurements from orthogonal arrays of solar cells. The two methodologies are tested and compared on ground hardware. Testing results show that coarse sun sensing is efficient even with minimal processing and complexity of design for satellite attitude determination systems and rover navigation systems.},

  abstract = {During the day of LAPAN A3 operation, the temperature of the multispectral Imager or LISA (Line Imager Space Applications), does not stay continually at the positive value, especially during May - June 2017 and 2018. Based on the beta angle variation, May and June have a minimum beta angle condition that affects LISA temperature. However, there are two procedures we perform for maintaining LISA temperature, both are the stop-release and the stop-release with additional roll angle. The idea in the stop-release maneuver is stopping the satellite for orbiting in nadir pointing mode, by giving 0 0/s of nadir rate or 00 of pitch angle, at specific latitude. After a certain duration, the satellite should be release into nadir pointing back at the same specific latitude. This method has a purpose to point some satellite side to the sun for the increasing temperature of the multispectral Imager. Meanwhile, the second method is giving roll angle before the satellite executes the stop maneuver. Before the release maneuver, the attitude must be fixed back by giving a negative value of roll angle. Based on the result, the stop-release maneuver could increase the LISA temperature when it executes at 200 of latitude in ascending orbit condition. Therefore, the additional roll angle in the stop-release maneuver could increase the LISA temperature better than only use a normal stop-release.},

The altitudes of the orbits are from 300 to 1,000 km. The local time of descending node is from 6 to 12. The combinations of the solar absorptivity and the infrared emissivity on the surface of the satellite in which the satellite satisfies the allowable temperature range, from 0 to 40 deg. C., are clarified for each of the above orbits. As the parameter of heat capacity of the satellite over one surface area of the satellite increases, the choice of combinations of the solar absorptivity and the infrared emissivity increases. The number of combinations in the case of the orbits without the shadow region is much larger than that with the shadow region. The number of combinations in the orbits without the shadow region increases with higher altitude and larger projected area with respect to the sun. The number of combinations in the orbits with the shadow region increases with higher altitude, larger projected area and smaller angle of the shadow region.},

A software module based on this methodology was developed and its performance was assessed by comparing its predictions with the ones obtained by a commercial software on the same test problem. Comparisons revealed that the external fluxes can be computed accurately with the developed module. It was then used in conjunction with an in-house thermal analysis code based on Thermal Network Method (TNM) and Monte Carlo Ray Tracing Technique (MCRT) for the transient simulation of the same test problem. It was shown that the temperature predictions obtained by the in-house code and the commercial software were in excellent agreement with each other and the developed software is a reliable, accurate and complete tool that can be used in the thermal analysis of satellites.},

  abstract = {The thermal design of spacecraft becomes increasingly complicated as various advanced technologies are continuously introduced to the spacecraft. Determining and optimizing the uncertainties of a spacecraft thermal control system through global sensitivity analysis has long been an essential task for thermal engineers. It is a difficult task that relies heavily on engineering experience and is a time-intensive, trial-and-error endeavor that may not even lead to global optimization. Hence, an intelligent optimization strategy based on statistical machine learning for spacecraft thermal design, called IOSML, is proposed. An intelligent batch processing system (IBPS) based on MATLAB, Python, and NX/TMG real-time data interaction is designed. The IBPS uses a surrogate model to reduce the computational cost of global sensitivity analysis while using a detailed thermal mathematical model to maintain accuracy. We combine a Bayesian inference framework with a neural network surrogate spacecraft-thermophysical model that is 100× faster than numerical solvers. This article first reports on a density-based global sensitivity analysis that evaluates the effect of design parameters on the temperature difference between the complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor and cold screen of the Lehman Alpha Solar Space Telescope detector. From 42 design parameters, the most sensitive four are selected for optimization, and the temperature difference and the boundary temperature are used as the objective function. Adopting IOSML, under no supervision, four design parameters are optimized through the IBPS, and the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by comparison with traditional methods. Additionally, IOSML is versatile and can be used in various complex engineering applications to provide guidance for the better selection of appropriate parameters and optimization.},

Most satellites use solar power as a source of energy, and so need to make sure that solar panels are oriented correctly with respect to the sun. Also, some satellites have sensitive instruments that must not be exposed to direct sunlight. For all these reasons, sun sensors are important components in spacecraft attitude determination and control systems. To minimize components and structural mass, some components have multiple purposes. The solar cells will provide power and also be used as coarse sun sensors.},

This paper introduces this formula which is based on the idea of a unit vector, S, originating from the observer’s location and pointing toward the center of the Sun. The vector is completely determined by the coordinates of the subsolar point and of the observer. The x- and y-components of the vector determine the solar azimuth angle, and their use along with the function atan2, which is available in a number of programming/scripting languages, including Fortran and Python, renders any circumstantial treatment absolutely unnecessary. The z-component of the vector, at the same time, determines the solar zenith angle. The use of the unit vector also facilitates a figure that can be used as a full 3D graphic depiction of the daily and annual cycles of the Sun’s position for any given location, and this figure can be called “wreath of analemmas”.},
